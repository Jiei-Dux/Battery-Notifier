# Battery-Notifier

**REASON WHY I MADE THIS:**

Someone recommended that I:
> keep the battery at 20% to 85% to avoid degrading my laptop battery.

KDE already has a built-in battery notifier that can do a lot of things that I want.

> ie. notify to plug in the charger or make the device sleep at certain threshold / level, custom notification sounds, notification duration, etc.

Unfortunately, it wasn't good enough and I couldn't figure out how to make it do the things I wanted to do

> ie. notify me to unplug the charger at certain threshold / level, etc.

so I tried searching around internet for a script that works the way I wanted to, unfortunately, none worked, so I thought to myself

> Why don't I just make one myself?
and so I did... and here it is... Im not a very creative person so I'm just going to call this thing Dux-Battery-Notifier...
